         <h2>Poem: Camouflaged by Kim McCrea</h2>
         <div>I found this short poem and liked it.</div>
         <div id="poem">
            <div><i>In all chaotic beauty lies a wounded work of art.</i></div>
            <div><i>Beautiful but torn, wreaking havoc on my heart.</i></div>
            <div><i>Camouflaged by insecurities, blinded by it all.</i></div>
            <div><i>I love the way you sit there and barely notice me at all.</i></div>

         <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
         <p>I like reading and discussing several nonfictional topics like history, philosopy, politics, and the sciences.
            I prefer to read nonfiction heavily over fiction because I like absorbing information and connecting previous knowledge
            I have about topics to new things I learn. I especially like philosophy and history and sometimes I read random articles or watch
            videos about these topics.
         </p>
         <p>I like to play the piano and cello. I have been playing the piano for about 12 years and the cello for about
            7.5 years. I mostly like to play songs from composers like Bach, Beethoven, Debussy, Chopin, etc. This is why I like the musical group
            The Piano Guys, as they consist of two guys who play the piano and cello. I also have something called perfect pitch which means I can 
            determine what musical note is being played and I can replicate the sound. I like listening to soundtracks or songs and trying to play them
            on the piano and cello. I want to try to get into music composition, like make my own song with both the piano and cello, but I'm not very creative.
         </p>
         <p>Other things I like to do include playing board games with my family, playing chess, and sometimes video games. Some board games I like
            include Risk, Catan, and Monopoly. I also like programming and have made a few simple games with Python plus some other projects involving
            Javascript.
